About learning
---
This article is ought to be more private than the [main article](https://github.com/BaksiLi/CS-Hypomnema/tree/master/README.md), a bit like a discussion but less formal. I decided to put some writings here because I didn't want to let them overstuff the collection. Since, as you may already noticed, I am a talkative person.

# Why bother to collect notes?
I initially created this repository for storing some of the notes from finished online courses and university lectures. 
 
At the first, I didn't expect myself to take down something that is detailed and well-polished, since I believe learning computer science requires kinaesthetic effort, that is to utilize rather than to revise. 
However, as the learning become more theoretical and in need of memorizing definitions, I decided to put more efforts on taking notes.

My strategy is, jot down important things when learning, and come back with books and other materials for adding details. Regurgitate information by reading textbooks and practical exercises, and turn them into knowledge.

The reason I put this collection on public domain is by doing so I could get a sort of feeling of responsibility of it.

# What is a Hypomnema? 
When I was doing my undergrad, I occasionally saw a professional person in the lecture theatre who helps students with inconvenience taking notes. This is why I call myself a 'note-taker' now, since most of the notes are really just a structured script from lectures. Of course, I add things into it, but still they are descendants of the lectures.

It is noted aptly in  [Curriculum Guidelines for Undergraduate Programs in Computer Science](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2534860) by ACM and IEEE Computer Society that:
> While computer science encompasses technologies that change rapidly over time, it is defined by essential concepts, perspectives, and methodologies that are constant.

<!-- Therefore, ... -->

I pursue a bottom-up approach to the discipline of computational artefact, rather than 'information hiding'.
