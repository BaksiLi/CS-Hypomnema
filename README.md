This repository curates my computer science notes.    
<sub>I used *Byword* (with Standard Markdown Syntax) for taking notes. However, it might encounter problems of compilation on GitHub, *esp.* with LaTeX. I will try to tackle this in the future. </sub>

# Catalogue
## I. Introductions
1. [***Introduction to Computer Science***](https://github.com/BaksiLi/CS-Hypomnema/blob/master/Resources/General/CS50x%20Intro%20to%20Computer%20Science.md) ![Editing](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-revising-lightgreen.svg)   
	Note based on CS50x 2017 course, the content and structure may be slightly different from the [official syllables](http://docs.cs50.net/2017/x/syllabus.html).	It covers the basics of C, Python, Javascript, HTML and CSS, as well as some important concepts in computer science like Computational Complexity and so on.
1. ***Introduction to Web Development*** ![Pending](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-Pending-orange.svg)    
	Note based on CS50w course. It covers Git, Flask, Django et.c.
1. ***Zsh (Z shell) Development with Comparison to Bash*** ![Pending](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-Pending-orange.svg)   
	This is a *Learn X in Y minutes*-styled tutorial for using Zsh for development. It act as a fast introduction for programmers, esp. those who have knowledge about Bash.

## II. Algotithmics & Mathematics
[//]: # (I am also planning to sort out a more detailed general Algorithm note from my previous notes.)   
There are open-source collections of algorithm implementations, which are useful during study, e.g. [Python](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Python) and [Java](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Java). Also for visualizations there is [Data Structure Visualizations](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/Algorithms.html).

1. ***Graph Theory and Algorithms (with Python)*** ![Pending](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-Pending-orange.svg)   
	A summary note from [NET04x](https://www.imt-atlantique.fr/fr/formation/moocs-et-cours-ouverts/moocs/advanced-algorithmics-and-graph-theory-python) (IMTx) and [ALGS202x](https://www.edx.org/course/graph-algorithms-uc-san-diegox-algs202x) (UCSanDiegoX). The former provided most of the algorithmics knowledge, whereas the latter course supported the note with mathematical details.
1. ***Coding theory (with Python)*** ![Pending](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-Pending-orange.svg)   
	This is a coding theory text with Python implementations. Not ready to upload so far.

## III. Scientific Programming
### i. Mathematica (Wolfram Language)
1. [***Learn Mathematica by Example***](https://github.com/BaksiLi/Wolflang-Workshop/blob/master/resources/myNote.nb) ![Editing](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-revising-lightgreen.svg)   
	I wrote this notebook alongside with learning. The official tutorial, [*Fast Introduction for math students*](http://www.wolfram.com/language/fast-introduction-for-math-students/en/) is a good source of reference as well.
1. 【Updating】***Wolflang Workshop***   
	Including NorthKoreaSleuthing.nb
### ii. Python
1. ***D-Wave machine Introduction*** ![Pending](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-Pending-orange.svg)   
	This was part of my undergraduate thesis topic. I will sort it up and upload it in the future. The code is available now, see [here](https://github.com/BaksiLi/CS-Hypomnema/tree/master/Resources/Quantum/mapcl.py)
