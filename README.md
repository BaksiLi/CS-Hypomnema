This repository curates my computer science notes.    
<sub>I used *Byword* (with Standard Markdown Syntax) for taking notes. However, it might encounter problems of compilation on GitHub, *esp.* with LaTeX. I will try to tackle this in the future. </sub>

# Catalogue
## I. Introduction to CS
1. [***CS50x: Introduction to Computer Science***](https://github.com/BaksiLi/CS-Hypomnema/blob/master/Resources/General/CS50x%20Intro%20to%20Computer%20Science.md)   
	Note of CS50x 2017 course, the content and structure may be slightly different from the [official syllables](http://docs.cs50.net/2017/x/syllabus.html). Nevertheless all the knowledge will be covered. The original course video and other supporting materials could be found in the [seminar page](http://cs50.tv/2017/fall/#about,lectures).
1. 【Upload Pending】 ***Zsh (Z shell) development with comparison to Bash***   
	This is a *Learn X in Y minutes*-styled tutorial for using Zsh for development. It act as a fast introduction for programmers, esp. those who have knowledge about Bash.
## II. Algorithmics
1. 【Upload Pending】***Graph Theory and Algorithms (with Python)***   
	A summary note from [NET04x](https://www.imt-atlantique.fr/fr/formation/moocs-et-cours-ouverts/moocs/advanced-algorithmics-and-graph-theory-python) (IMTx) and [ALGS202x](https://www.edx.org/course/graph-algorithms-uc-san-diegox-algs202x) (UCSanDiegoX). The former provided most of the algorithmics knowledge, whereas the latter course supported the note with mathematical details.
1. 【Upload Pending】***Coding theory (with Python)***   
	This is a coding theory text with Python implementations. Not ready to upload so far.
## III. Scientific Programming
### i. Mathematica (Wolfram Language)
1. [***Learning Mathematica by example***](https://github.com/BaksiLi/Wolflang-Workshop/blob/master/resources/myNote.nb)   
	I wrote this notebook alongside with learning. The official tutorial, [*Fast Introduction for math students*](http://www.wolfram.com/language/fast-introduction-for-math-students/en/) is a good source of reference as well.
1. 【Updating】***Wolflang Workshop***   
	Including NorthKoreaSleuthing.nb
### ii. Python
1. 【Upload Pending】***D-Wave machine Introduction***
	This was part of my undergraduate thesis topic. I will sort it up and upload it in the future.
